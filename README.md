# Cloud Note App (CNA)

Cloud Note App is my first full-stack serverless web app built on AWS serverless infrastructure.
This is the client part for CNA.

## Serverless Stack (SST)
[Serverless Stack (SST)](https://serverless-stack.com/) is a framework that makes it easy to build serverless apps. It is free resource to help you build full-stack serverless apps.
First, you'll learn how to create your note-taking full-stack Serverless application. Then you'll learn the best practices of running production applications. These really begin to matter once your application codebase grows or when you add more folks to your team.
